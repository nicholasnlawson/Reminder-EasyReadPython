# Placeholder Images

This directory contains placeholder images for the Easy Read Pictorial feature.

In a production environment, you would replace these with actual images representing:

- medication.png - A generic medication image
- morning.png - Morning time (sunrise)
- noon.png - Noon time (sun at zenith)
- afternoon.png - Afternoon time
- evening.png - Evening time (sunset)
- bedtime.png - Bedtime (moon/stars)
- with_food.png - Taking medication with food
- without_food.png - Taking medication without food
- food_optional.png - Taking medication with or without food

For now, you can use any appropriate icons or create simple images to represent these concepts.
